"""The shared HTTP layer behind `search` and `fetch`.

Every request this package makes goes through `fetch_url`, which exists to
make two promises the rest of the package depends on.

The first is that no request needs a key. Every search engine reached from
here is a public endpoint, so the package works on a fresh install with
nothing configured.

The second is that a request is hard to block and never blocks. Hosts that
refuse a request do it on fingerprint reputation, so a retry after a 403 or a
429 presents a different browser user agent rather than repeating the one that
was just refused; that alone clears most transient blocks. And every call is
async with a hard timeout, so a slow host delays its own result and nothing
else -- a search queries its engines concurrently and keeps whatever comes
back in time.

Requests are also guarded against pointing back inward. A URL that resolves to
a private, loopback, or link-local address is refused before it is sent, on
the original URL and again on every redirect hop, so a caller cannot be
steered into the machine's own network.
