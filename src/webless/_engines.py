"""The keyless search back ends and the fusion that merges them.

Each engine here is a public endpoint that answers without credentials: three
scrape a normal results page, three read a public JSON or OpenSearch API. None
of them is trusted to be up. `search_web` queries them concurrently, keeps
whatever answers inside the deadline, and fuses the surviving rankings, so an
engine that is blocked, rate limited, or simply slow costs recall rather than
the whole call.

Fusion is Reciprocal Rank Fusion: a result's score is the sum of ``1 / (k +
rank)`` over the engines that returned it. Rank is all it needs, which is the
point -- the engines disagree about scoring and none of them exposes a
comparable number, but they all produce an ordered list, and a page several
independent indexes rank highly is a better answer than one page's favourite.
